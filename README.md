# google-homepage-clone repository
This is a basic google.com homepage clone with just html and css. Its a test and the aim of this is to achieve a fluid and responsive google.com homepage.
Also i'm fairly new to web development, so any ideas and commits as to achieving the aforementioned are welcome (I understand this is basic to most people) but i'd really appreciate the help.
