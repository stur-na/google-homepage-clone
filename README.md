# google-homepage-clone repository
This is s basic google.com homepage clone with just html and css
This is a test and the aim of this is to achieve a fluid and responsive google.com homepage
I'm fairly new to web development and any ideas and commits are welcome as to achieving this(I understand this is basic to most people)
